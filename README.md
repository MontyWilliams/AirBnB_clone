#Air BNB
> Find some R&R at a BNB bro

# ABOUT:

This project is the first stage of creating an AirBNB clone for Holberton's Higher Level Programming course. In this project we build a custom command-line interface for data management using all the skills we've learned in Python. Bro

# Console:

The console is the command line interace which allows user to create allowed classes, delete classes, and add attributes to classes. This console (should) work in interactive and non-interacive mode. Bro

# How to start:

Functions in 2 modes, interactive and non interactive

## interactive mode
To launch:

> /AirBnb_clone$ ./console.py

Once launced you will be presented with a new (hbnb) prompt ready to accept commands.

Example:
> (hbnb) create BaseModel

## Non-Interacive Mode

To use in non-interactive mode echo the commands and pipe it to console.py Example:
> AirBnb_clone$ echo "create BaseModel" | ./console.py
